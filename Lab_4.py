This program allos a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question.
question = "what is the capital of California". The answer is Sacramerto

We frist set max_tries = 3. Then we create a loop to iterate three times. 
For each  iteration, we ask the user for the answer (user input). 
Then based on the answer the user gives, we check to see if the user
input matches the answer. If so, print "Correct!" then terminate the loop
a break statement.

If the user could not guess the correct answer within the max_tries,
then print "You have used up your allotment of guesses.", the print 
"The correct answer is 'California'"
